#  Torrent Player

A simple **web-based torrent streaming player** built with WebTorrent.js.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the site hosted on GitHub Pages.
2. Paste a magnet link or `.torrent` URL.
3. Click **Load** → see the file list.
4. Click **Stream** to play video/audio files directly in the browser.

## ⚠️ Notes
- Only playable media files (`.mp4`, `.mp3`, etc.) stream directly in browser.
- Other files (e.g., `.zip`, `.iso`) will still appear but cannot be streamed.
